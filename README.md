# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my personal collection of solutions to the problems presented in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Each solution is meticulously crafted using [Pyhton 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

The repository is organized by days, with each day having its own dedicated folder. These folders contain both the inputs for the dayâ€™s problem and the corresponding solution.

In addition, an script [Engine.py](https://github.com/Pw-Wolf/Advent_Of_Code_2023/blob/main/engine.py) is incorporated to streamline the process. This script is responsible for downloading the daily input and creating the respective folder. Any functions that are reused across different days are conveniently stored within this script for easy access and efficiency.
